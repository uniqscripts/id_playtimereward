## About This Resource

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/Z7PxQhE.png">Preview Resource</a>

This resource gives your players vehicle as a reward (can be changed very easily) for playing for X hours (can be set uped in shared/config.lua) 

Every 60 minutes, the hour counter is moved by +1, making players being close to the prize, and every 60 seconds, 1 minute on the minute counter is reduced (when the minute counter is on 0, a hour will be added and a minute counter will be restarted).

It is fully responsive, like any of our other resources that contain NUI.

**Reward**, money amount, item, item count, plates (letters, numbers and spaces) and vehicle name that will be given as a reward can be configured in the **config.lua** file.
